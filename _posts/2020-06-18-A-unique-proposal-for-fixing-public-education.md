Unequal access to education is surely one of the key challenges facing modern governments and society as a whole. Its not enough to create more public schools or to provide free university, the standards also need to be of a high enough standard to produce the kinds of outcomes that people need in order to prosper. 

I stumbled on a interesting and novel approach to addressing the education challenge in a book published in 2004 called Investing In Human Capital, by Economist Miguel Palacios. The book has contributed to the discussion and development of alternative forms of student finance in recent years. In particular its helped to develop the concept of income contingent loans and income share agreements. These types of finance models are increasingly being applied by universities, coding bootcamps, and by alternative student finance companies. 

But, more importantly (for this article anyway) the book also puts forward a compelling model for Governments to fund education. This particular model covers only a few pages of the book, but its an idea I keep coming back to. Its elegant, maybe a bit radical, and it seems to have completely fallen through the cracks of history. I cannot find any discussion or reference to this particular model outside of the book (if anyone has seen this idea elsewhere please correct me on this point). I feel it deserves to see the light of day, so lets dive in. 

## Government Human Capital Contracts

**The idea is for the government to invite private investors to finance the education of tertiary learners. In return, the government commits to repaying the investor a share of the future tax revenue which it (the Government) collects from that learner down the line (if and when the learner enters the working economy and pays income tax).** 

I will refer to this idea as Government Human Capital Contracts (or "GHCC").

(side note: the original idea presented by Palacios looks at ways to fund normal schooling, but for reasons that will become clear later, I'm going to discuss its application to tertiary education) 

Lets explore some of the details:

Any student that receives funding from this initiative is not out of pocket in any way and has to pay nothing back to the financier. The repayment to the financier comes out of the income tax, which the student has to pay anyway if they enter the working economy.  

The funders do not choose specific individuals to fund. Instead they fund all students in a specific course or college (I use the word "college" to refer to any type of institution that provides tertiary education). Funders are essentially betting on certain courses to produce successful learners. If their bet is successful, the government wins, because the government has a new batch of taxpayers. As such, the government commits to sharing some of that upside with the investor in order to reward the bet.

As a result the government gets to keep less income tax from the learner, but perhaps, had the learner not benefited from the funding, he or she would be paying little or no income tax anyway.

In theory its a win-win all round. The investor gets a return on investment. The student gets a better education. And the government gets a more educated and productive citizen (which of course benefits society at large).

The benefit of this model is twofold; Firstly it provides new sources of funding. Secondly, the particular repayment criteria is such that it helps to ensure that funds are spent optimally.
