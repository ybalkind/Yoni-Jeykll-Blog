I recently stumbled on an interesting and novel approach to tackling the problem of unequal access to education. It came from a book called Investing In Human Capital (published in 2004) by Economist Miguel Palacios. 

The book is known in the niche world of alternative student finance for having helped to create awareness of finance models such as income contingent loans and income share agreements. These  models are increasingly being applied by universities, coding bootcamps, and by alternative student finance companies. These models were not invented by Palacios, but he helped develop and to raise awareness of these models. 

But there is one proposed model in the book which I believe is completely novel. It is a way for government to fund education out of a learner's future tax revenue. This particular model covers only a few pages of the book, but its an idea I keep coming back to. It is elegant, maybe a bit radical, and it seems to have completely fallen through the cracks of history. I cannot find any discussion or reference to this particular model outside of the book (if anyone has seen this idea elsewhere please correct me on this point). I feel it deserves to see the light of day, hence this post. 

## Government Human Capital Contracts

The basic idea is for the Government to invite private investors to finance the education of tertiary learners. In return, the government commits to repaying the investor a share of the future tax revenue which it (the Government) collects from that learner down the line (if and when the learner enters the working economy and pays income tax).

I will refer to this idea as Government Human Capital Contracts (or "GHCC").

(side note: the original idea presented by Palacios looks at ways to fund normal schooling, but for reasons that will become clear later, I'm going to discuss its application specifically to tertiary education) 

Lets explore some of the details:

Any student that receives funding from this initiative is not out of pocket in any way and has to pay nothing back to the financier. The repayment to the financier comes out of the income tax, which the student has to pay anyway if they enter the working economy.  

The funders do not choose specific individuals to fund. Instead they fund all students in a specific course or college (I use the word "college" to refer to any type of institution that provides tertiary education). Funders are essentially betting on certain courses to produce successful learners. If their bet is successful, the government wins, because the government has a new batch of taxpayers. As such, the government commits to sharing some of that upside with the investor in order to reward the bet.

As a result the government gets to keep less income tax from the learner, but perhaps, had the learner not benefited from the funding, he or she would be paying little or no income tax anyway.

In theory its a win-win all round. The investor gets a return on investment. The student gets a better education. And the government gets a more educated and productive citizen (which of course benefits society at large).

The benefit of this model is twofold; Firstly it provides new sources of funding. Secondly, the particular repayment criteria is such that it helps to ensure that funds are spent optimally. 

## How do GHCC's deliver education to those who most need it?

The return on investment for the financier is contingent on the eventual earnings of the learner. Investors would therefore want to fund the best and brightest students with the best career prospects. 

To some extent this is fine. Normal government models for tertiary funding also take into account how well a student did in school before the student is funded. But at the same time, these government models are designed with equality in mind.

The danger with inviting private funding is that, unlike government, they are not serving the public good. They might therefore prioritise students from privileged backgrounds as these may be deemed more likely to succeed and thus less risky an investment. It would thus be important for Government to ensure that the rules of the scheme do not entrench patters of inequality. 

Fortunately, Government are the ones who repay the debt so they control who gets funding. Government has little incentive in taking on funding for privileged learners who already have good career prospects - why give away future tax revenue when that revenue is already pretty much guaranteed? 

Instead, the incentive for Government is in taking on investment for poor learners who would otherwise struggle to get a good education. If those students can be well educated and prepared for the workforce, then that is bonus tax revenue for the government, and its well worth parting with some of that tax revenue if someone is willing to take on the cost and risk of funding the student. 

## Attracting finance

If government only seeks funding for the students with the least prospects, would investors be interested at all? How do Investors get a return on students with poor career prospects?

Firstly, Government would have to offer healthy returns to compensate for the risk on investors. But the poorest people are those with the lowest likelihood of contributing much tax. Having uneducated adults is a drain on the economy, and having more educated productive people is a huge benefit that passes onto subsequent generations. As such government can justify giving away a hefty portion of tax revenue derived from people who would otherwise had remained poor had they not been successfully educated. 

Although paying a premium return can go some way towards helping to attract investors there still needs to be a way to give funders confidence that the learners will actually be successful. If Government is struggling to educate a large portion of the population. Why should we think that private investment would yield better outcomes?

## Market forces can help achieve better outcomes

This gets to the heart of what makes GHCC's special and interesting.

Delivering a good education to millions of people is a massively onerus task for any government. Especially in a fast changing world where its hard to know what skills are needed for what jobs.

The South Africa Goverment provides free higher education. But how efficient is it in ensuring that the right courses and colleges are funded? I suspect the amount of wasteage and inefficeincy is massive. 

GHCC's changes the game because it passes on the complexity to the market. Its introduces a self adjusting mechanism that naturally optimises to deliver better education outcomes. Investor are only going to fund colleges that are outcome driven and where the skills being taught are in demand.  

GHCC increases the likelihood of education success because it provides instant market feedback as to the expected success of a particular college or course. If government tries to get two different courses funded and investors only support one of the courses, that feedback tells government that the other course is considered wasteful. It ensures that funds flow efficiently to where outcomes are expected to be successful. 

Why should investors have better knowledge than government? Because that is just how the world works. Investors who make bad predictions, go out of business, those that make good predictions succeed and have more capital to invest. The market, for all its flaws, is better than government at creating value out of complexity. 

GHCCs bring a whole lot of new funding to the system, and market forces incentivise that the educational sector up its game so as to qualify for that funding. 

There are other Government funding models that incorporate market feedback such Social Impact Bonds and Income Contingent Government Loans (as offered by the Australian Government). The difference is that those existing models require government to interpret that feedback and to determine how funds should be distributed. GHCC are theoretically more efficient because funds are distributed by private investors who are incentivised to achieve the best outcomes. 

Market forces would gradually give rise to the colleges that society and learners need. Public schooling today is more or less the same as it was 60 years ago. It is ineffecient and ineffective, and ill suited for the information age. GHCC presents an exciting mechanism to accelerate the reform of the tertiary education system to make it more efficient and relevant for the modern world. 

Another advantage of creating this market mechanism is that it provides a clear signal to learners about where and what to study. The best courses and colleges will be free.  

## Conclusion 

Despite my enthusism for GHCC, I'm cogniscent of many challenges and obstacles that such an idea would have to overcome (even if Government were sold on the idea). What percentage of tax revenue per learner is paid back to the funder and for how many years do we repay? Do the repayments get capped? Should we allow funding of traditional colleges only, or also allow funding for alternative education paths such as coding bootcamps and online courses? How do you ensure you're not giving away too max tax revenue? How do you track the students and their tax payments and ensure repayment to investors. 

It is beyond the scope of this article to cover these in detail. If this gets any attention then I will certainly look to explore the topic in much more depth. But in the interim I recommend reading the source of idea - Miguel Palacios' book Investing in Human Capital. It addresses most of the above questions and more.

I've only spoken about tertiary education so far, but there is only so much you can fix at this level of the education pipeline. So much of learning outcomes depends on what happens at school and even pre-school level (nevermind factors outside of school that impact on learning outcomes). 

As I mentioned earlier, Miguel Palacios put forward GHCC as a means to fund normal school education. The reason I focused on Tertiary education is that it makes it much easier to test the model and establish its effectiveness when there is only a few years between investment and job. 

In theory though, the GHCC model could gradually be expanded to lower levels of school, and that is where it could really unlock much bigger benefits for society. 

I mentioned at the start that Palacios originally invisioned for this model to apply to normal schooling. 
If governments dont radically change their approach then what reason is there to think that the situation will improve. 

## Acknowledgements
Thank you to Miguel Palacios not only for originating the idea of Government Human Capital Contracts (for the record he actually used the term "State Human Capital Contracts"), but also for graciously giving of his time to discuss his ideas with me. 

Thank you also to Andrew Pooley (co-founder of Umuzi) for reading my early drafts and helping stress test the idea. Hopefully I can do a follow up piece that dives into the detail and challenges that you helped me to understand.
