Hi I'm Yoni Balkind This is my blog. I'm a guy in Johannesburg South Africa. Learn more About me.<br>

This place is a beautiful mess just like my mind. The best way to use this blog is just to click on links as and when you find them, or start on the Topics page and click from there.

Although I refer to this as a blog, its more like an open workshop for my thoughts and ideas (you could call it a personal wiki or memex). Read more about How I use this blog to get a sense for what this place is about.

This website is a bit different to other blogs. Its built differently and navigates differently. If you care about these sort of things you can read about how this blog is built and why its built this way.
