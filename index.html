<p>Hi I'm Yoni Balkind. This is my public notebook. Its a bit like a blog but its more a place to publicly develop my thinking and as such I call it a gallery of notes.</p> 
  
<p>Click "About this site" for more info on how this site works, or on "All notes" to dive into my notes<p>

[p>I live in Johannesburg, South Africa. I work at the intersection of law and digital but I'm also a autodidact with a broad range of interest as my notes will reflect as they develop. Visit my [personal site](https://yonibalkind.com) for more info about me and my work</p>
