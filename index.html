<p>Hi I'm Yoni Balkind. This is my public notebook. Its a space where I try make sense of the world, play with ideas and learn in public.</p> 

<p>I write about strategic product management and how teams can more reliably ship products that delight customers and achieve business success. I also like to explore ways to make work more streamlined, effective and meaningful. Sometimes I may explore more expansive questions around how we can better think, live, and co-exist</p>

<p>I live in Johannesburg, South Africa and I work as a senior Product Leader at Lexis Nexis. I previously founded and grew GoLegal.co.za into one of South Africa's largest onine legal information portals</p>
