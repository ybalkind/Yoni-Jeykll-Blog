A while back I was reading an economics book called Investing In Human Capital by Miguel Palacios. The book is mostly focused on exploring ways of funding higher education, but in one chapter it went on a slight detour and presented a unique idea for financing elementary, primary and high school.

This "side" idea struck a cord with me and months later I keep coming back to it. I cannot find anything like this idea anywhere outside of this book and I'm not sure why. Its seems to me to be such a compelling and exciting idea that I want to try and put it out in the world and generate some discussion around it.

Let me set out the basics of the idea straight away, and we can then unpack it in more detail.

The idea is for the government to invite private investors to fund the schooling of any child.

In return, the government commits to repaying the investor a share of the future tax revenue which it (the government) collects from that learner down the line if and when the learner enters the working economy and pays income tax.

Any student that receives funding from this initiative is not out of pocket in any way and has to pay nothing back to the financier. The repayment to the financier comes out of the income tax which the student has to pay anyway if they enter the working economy.

The funders do not choose specific individuals to fund. Instead they fund all students in a specific school. They are essentially betting on certain schools to produce successful learners. If their bet is successful, the government wins, because the government has a new batch of taxpayers and fewer people living off of grants. As such, the government commits to sharing some of that upside with the investor in order to reward the bet.

Investors will obviously only invest in schools which they believe will produce successful learners. Government will thus fail to attract investment unless they can create good schools.

If normal Government schools fail to attract investment, then Government can subcontract the creation and management of schools to private entities which satisfy the investors. Or government can simply allow private schools to join the scheme under qualifying criteria (such as opening in under-served areas for underprivileged learners).

In the same way that private investment supports the economy and ensures that government cannot stray too far from market friendly policies, so market forces will help drive the school system ensuring that schools are created (one way or another) that produce successful learners.

If your politics is such that you are uncomfortable with the idea of market forces affecting the school system, keep in mind that this scheme is a closed loop. Return on investment is driven simply by the success of the learners. The specific market forces in play here genuinely drive the outcomes that help learners to become economically independent and prosperous. There is no restriction or impositions on the learners. They still choose which schools to attend (but they have better choices), they have no additional obligations, they are not party to the contract, they are simply beneficiaries.

Market forces would steers government to create the schools that investors want, and this would inadvertently give rise to the schools that society and learners need.

Government simply has to put the right control measures in place to ensure that the beneficiaries are those that most need it. And market forces steer the government to focus on underprivileged learners.

The scheme gives government a new way to fund schooling. The amount of available funding is limited only by the amount of potential tax revenue that the students can be expected to generate.
